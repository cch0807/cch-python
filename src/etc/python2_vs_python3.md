# Python2
### History
- Introduced in 2000
- make programming simple and easy to learn for the common mass

### Syntax
- print "Hello World" # statement

### Storage of Strings
- ASCII: a method of encoding English characters with an assigned number Do not have a enough symbols due to 7 bits

### Libraries
- Not forward compatible, Hard to porting from Python2 to Python3 is hell No longer supported by the year 2020

### Division of Integers
- Round down for the integer division (9 divided by 4 is 2)

### Variable leakage
- The values of global variables do change in Pyhton 2 if they are used inside a for-loop.

### Use case
- Used by DevOps engineer

# Python3
### History
- Introduced in 2008
- redundancy - writing repetitive code or writing the same piece of code again and again - should be removed from coding

### Syntax
- print("Hello World") # function

### Stroage of Strings
- Unicode: the practical UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit) support foreign languages and other widely used symbols and emojis.

### Libraries
- Backward-incompatible. Always gear toward future improvements A lot of libraries are specific for Python3

### Division of Integers
- Exact number (9 divided by 4 is 2.25)

### Variable leakage
- The value of variables never changes in Python 3.

### Use case
- Used by Software Engineer, Data Science and etc
