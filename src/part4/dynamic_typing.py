# Dynamic Typing
# Dynamic Type vs Type vs Strong typing

# Dynamic typing means that runtime objects (values)
# have a type, as opposed to static typing where variables have a type.

# Strong typing means that variables do have a type and that the type matters
# when perfoming perations on a variable.

# print(1 + "a")

a = 1
# print(type(a))

a = "A"
print(type(a))

# static typing eg. Java
# public class HelloTypes {

#     public static void main(String[] args) {

#         String thing;
#         thing = "Hello World";

#         thing = 42;

#         System.out.println(thing);
#     }
# }
